abstract: Gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation are two highly correlated tasks, yet they are often handled separately. In this paper, we present a novel collaborative learning network for joint gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation. The proposed network exploits joint-aware features that are crucial for both tasks, with which gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation boost each other to learn highly discriminative features and models. In addition, a novel multi-order feature analysis method is introduced which learns posture and multi-order motion information from the intermediate feature maps of videos effectively and efficiently. Due to the exploitation of joint-aware features in common, the proposed technique is capable of learning gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation even when only gesture or pose labels are available, and this enables weakly supervised network learning with much reduced data labeling efforts. Extensive experiments show that our proposed method achieves superior gesture recognition and 3D hand pose estimation performance as compared with the state-of-the-art. Codes and models will be released upon the paper acceptance. "
