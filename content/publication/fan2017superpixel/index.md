abstract: This paper presents a new technique for hyperspectral image (HSI) classification by using superpixel guided deep-sparse-representation learning. The proposed technique constructs a hierarchical architecture by exploiting the sparse coding to learn the HSI representation. Specifically, a multiple-layer architecture using different superpixel maps is designed, where each superpixel map is generated by downsampling the superpixels gradually along with enlarged spatial regions for labeled samples. In each layer, sparse representation of pixels within every spatial region is computed to construct a histogram via the sum-pooling with l 1 normalization. Finally, the representations (features) learned from the multiple-layer network are aggregated and trained by a support vector machine classifier. The proposed technique has been evaluated over three public HSI data sets, including the Indian Pines image set, the Salinas image set, and the University of Pavia image set. Experiments show superior performance compared with the state-of-the-art methods.
