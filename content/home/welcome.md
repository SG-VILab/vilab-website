<p style="font-size:14px; font-family:Arial; ">In <font color="#FF0000"> VILab </font> (Visual Intelligence Lab), we work with visual data with a target for humanlike perception and creation of visual worlds. The research involves both discriminative tasks in classification, detection and segmentation as well as generative tasks in translation, composition, and editing. We work with different data modalities including 2D optical images, multi-spectral images, 3D point cloud, etc., and interpret them with different learning approaches including supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, unsupervised domain adaption and generalization, self-supervised learning, etc. Altogether, VILab works towards humanlike visual intelligence.</p>
