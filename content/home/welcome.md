<p style="font-size:14px; font-family:Arial; ">In the Visual Intelligence Lab (VILab), we work with visual data targeting for humanlike perception, understanding and creation of visual worlds. The research in VILab involves both discriminative tasks in image classification, object detection, semantic segmentation as well as generative tasks in image translation, image composition, and image editing. We work with different data modalities including 2D optical images, multi-spectral images, 3D point cloud, etc., and interpret them with different learning approaches including supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning (domain adaption and generalization), self-supervised learning, etc. Altogether, VILab works towards humanlike visual intelligence.</p>
